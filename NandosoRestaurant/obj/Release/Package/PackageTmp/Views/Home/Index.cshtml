        <h2>Firing up New Zealand</h2>
        <p>The Nando’s cockerel landed on the fair shores of Aotearoa in December 2000 and 
        New Zealand discovered a new flavour sensation for a new millennium. 
        It didn't take long for the word to get around or for the people of Auckland 
        to get addicted to spicing things up with a fix of flame-grilled PERi-PERi chicken.
         Not surprisingly really - Kiwis have always had a passion for great natural produce 
        and big bold flavours.
        Thanks to their passion for PERi-PERi, Nando's spread north and south, and today,
         there are more than thirty Nando's restaurants serving succulent flame-grilled PERi-PERi 
        chicken with Afro-Portuguese inspired side dishes. Come try some!
